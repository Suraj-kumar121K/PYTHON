--> What is String
    a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

-->  You can use:
     Single quotes ' '
     Double quotes " "
     Triple quotes ''' ''' or """ """ (for multi-line strings)

--> 🟢 Example:
        a ='suraj' # Single quoted string
        b = "suraj" # Double quoted string
        c = '''suraj''' # Triple quoted string
        d = """suraj""" # Multiline quoted Line

--> ✍️ 2. String Creation
          You can create strings in different ways:
a = 'Python'
b = "Learning"
c = '''Data Science'''

--> 🔤 3. Accessing Characters
          Strings are index-based — each character has a position (index).

Character      --	 P	 y	 t  	h  	o  	n
                   -----------------------
Index	         --  0	 1	 2	  3	  4	  5
                   ------------------------
Negative Index --  (-5) (-4) (-3) (-2) (-1)

--> The index in a sting starts from 0 to (length -1) in Python. In order to slice a string, we use

--> Example:
word = "Python"
print(word[0])   # P
print(word[5])   # n
