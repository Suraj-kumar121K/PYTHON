--> What is Variable
    A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program. For example
a = 12          # variables = container to store a value.
b = 1.73        # identifiers = class/function/variable name
Name = "suraj"  # keywords = reserved words in python
print(a + b);
print(Name); 

--> DATA TYPES
Primarily these are the following data types in Python:
1. Integers
2. Floating point numbers
3. Strings
4. Booleans
5. None

--> Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.
a= 71 # identifies a as class <int>
b=88.44 # identifies b as class <float>
name= "Suraj" # identifies name as class <str>
d = False # d is a boolean variable
e = None # e is a null value

--> Checking Data Type
You can check the data type of any variable using:

--> Syntax
   type(variable_name)

--> Example:
    x = 10
    print(type(x))   # Output: <class 'int'>

--> RULES FOR CHOOSING AN IDENTIFIER
• A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscores.
• A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscores.
• A variable name can’t start with a digit.
• No while space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
    
--> Examples of a few variable names are: Suraj, one8, seven, _seven etc.
