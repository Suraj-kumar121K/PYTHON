--> What is Variable
    A variable is the name given to a memory location in a program. For example
""" a = 12      # variables = container to store a value.
b = 1.73        # identifiers = class/function/variable name
Name = "suraj"  # keywords = reserved words in python
print(a + b);
print(Name); """
